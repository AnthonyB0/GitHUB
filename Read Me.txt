classname.cpp: Implementation file for LinkedList
Description of the role or purpose of objects of this class goes here.

The LinkedList class is designed to create a linked list data structure that can store multiple Nodes. Each Node stores an integer redid, first name, last name and a pointer to the next Node. LinkedList class contains various functions to manipulate the data in the list.

PUBLIC MEMBER VARIABLES
Node *head; - Points to the first element in the list
Node *tail; - Points to the last element in the list
int length; - Number of elements in the list

CONSTRUCTORS
LinkedList(int value, string first, string last):
Constructor that initializes the LinkedList with one Node containing integer value, first and last name

Destructor:
Deallocates memory and deletes all the nodes in the list

OTHER PUBLIC MEMBER FUNCTIONS
printList():
Prints all the elements in the list.

getHead():
Prints the redid, first and last name of the first element in the list.

getTail():
Prints the redid, first and last name of the last element in the list.

getLength():
Prints the length of the list.

get(int index):
Returns a pointer to the Node at the specified index. If the index is out of range, it returns nullptr.

set(int index, int value, string first, string last):
Sets the value, first and last name of the Node at the specified index. If the index is out of range, it returns false.

append(int value, string first, string last):
Appends a new Node to the end of the list with the specified value, first and last name.

prepend(int value, string first, string last):
Prepends a new Node to the start of the list with the specified value, first and last name.

insert(int index, int value, string first, string last):
Inserts a new Node with the specified value, first and last name at the specified index. If the index is out of range, it returns false.

deleteFirst():
Deletes the first Node in the list.

deleteLast():
Deletes the last Node in the list.

Precondition: LinkedList class object has been initialized.
Postcondition: The class methods can be used to manipulate and retrieve data from the linked list object.
